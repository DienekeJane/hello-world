# hello-world
This my repository to test GitHub functionality

I have no files it in as of yet, but I am sure they will follow.

It seems the next step in the tutorial to understand branches and a master is to edit the read me file.

I want to test the different statements that merge files.

So that is why I am adding 2 commits.

And now the last test of the day.

With 2 commits again.
